# Presentations

I will be using Markdown and *Marp* to write presentations. You can learm more about it [here](https://github.com/marp-team/marp) and [here](https://github.com/hahnec/marp-recipes).

## Building

You can build and open the HTML presentation using:

```sh
marp elixir_2023/slides.md
open elixir_2023/slides.html
```
